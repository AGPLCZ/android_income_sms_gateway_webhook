# Simple incoming SMS to URL forwarder
Set sender phone number or name and URL. If you want to send any SMS - use * (asterisk symbol) as a name.
Every incoming SMS will be sent immediately to provided URL.
Use it as Webhook for your SMS

## Limitations
The current version will try to send a text to the URL immediately. If no Internet connection, the app will retry once later.
The app will not check the HTTP response code. If the server responded with any code, it will be treated as sent.
